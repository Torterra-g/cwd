  <h1>A Conversation</h1>

  <p class="greg">We need to talk...</p>

  <p class="martha">About what?</p>

  <p class="greg">It's about the money, you have been waisting too much money.</p>

  <p class="martha">I know a lot of people, which means a lot of birthdays.</p>

  <p> class="greg"I think they would understand that we can't afford many gifts.</p>
